  We organize monthly events, PublicTechMeetups (PTMs), to learn and teach online privacy and security skills in a relaxed and open format. PTMs draw inspiration from Cryptoparty, a decentralized, global initiative to introduce the most basic cryptography software and the fundamental concepts of their operation to the general public, such as the Tor anonymity network, public key encryption (PGP/GPG) , and OTR (Off The Record messaging).

Paraphrasing Jelaluddin Rumi, come, come, whoever you are. Wanderer, worshiper, lover of leaving. It doesnâ€™t matter. Ours is not a caravan of mocking plaintext. Come, even if you have not encrypted your communications a million times. Come, yet again, come, come.

Sign up here to receive announcements of future events.
